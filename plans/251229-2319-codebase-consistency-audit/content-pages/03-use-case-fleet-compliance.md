# Why Fleet Managers Are Overpaying on Insurance

## Insurance Premiums Keep Rising

Your insurer doesn't trust your safety protocols. They charge 30-50% more
when you can't PROVE drivers are wearing seat belts.

That's $5,000-$15,000 extra per year for a mid-sized fleet.
$50,000+ for larger operations. You're bleeding money every single month
on what you DON'T have—documented compliance.

**You're already doing the training. You're already paying more.**
**Get the proof that lowers your costs.**

---

## One Accident Costs Everything

WorkCover investigation. Public liability lawsuit. Driver injury claim.
Negligence finding.

All because you couldn't prove the driver was belted. Even if they were,
without documentation, you're liable. Your business. Your assets.
Your personal liability.

**One system. One installation. Five years of protection.**

---

## Can't Monitor 100 Drivers

You have 50+ vehicles across 3 states. Drivers work night shifts,
solo routes, remote locations. You can't be everywhere.

You're trusting drivers to follow protocol. But drivers are human.
They get complacent. They take shortcuts on long routes.

**One unbuckled driver in an accident = YOUR liability.**

# Fleet-Wide Compliance. One Dashboard.

[Fleet Dashboard Screenshot - Multi-vehicle view]

## How It Protects Your Bottom Line

### 1. Fleet Compliance Dashboard
See every vehicle in your fleet on one screen.
- Green icon = driver belted
- Red icon = unbuckled driving detected
- Yellow icon = vehicle parked/offline

Drill down to individual driver data. See compliance rates by driver,
by vehicle, by route. Identify problems before they become claims.

**Result: 94%+ fleet-wide compliance within 30 days.**

---

### 2. Automated Reporting for Insurers
Weekly and monthly compliance reports automatically generated.
Perfect data for:
- Insurance premium negotiations
- WorkCover audits
- Safety accreditation
- Board reporting

**Insurers LOVE this data.** It's proof you're managing risk.
Average clients see **30-50% premium reductions** at renewal.

---

### 3. Real-Time Alert System
When unbuckled driving is detected:
- **Manager notification**: Email + SMS instantly
- **Driver reminder**: In-vehicle audio alert
- **Documentation**: Logged for training/coaching

Correct behavior in real-time. Not at the quarterly review.
When it actually matters.

---

### 4. Historical Data & Trend Analysis
- Track driver compliance over time
- Identify problem patterns (specific routes, times, drivers)
- Training data for performance reviews
- Proof of continuous improvement for auditors

**Data that protects you AND improves performance.**

## Featured: Regional Transport Services

**The Problem**: $18,000 annual insurance premium. Insurers wouldn't reduce
despite clean safety record. Couldn't prove seat belt compliance.

**The Solution**: Installed fleet monitoring across 47 vehicles.
3-week installation. Manager dashboard + driver alerts.

**The Results**:
- Insurance reduced to $10,200 (43% savings)
- $7,800 annual savings

# Common Questions from Fleet Managers

### "Will my insurer actually accept this data?"

**Yes. 100% acceptance rate.** We've designed reports specifically for
insurance underwriters. All major Australian insurers accept our data:
Allianz, CGU, QBE, Suncorp, Zurich, and 20+ regional providers.

We can provide sample reports for your insurer before you buy.

---

### "How long to install across 50 vehicles?"

**3-4 weeks for 50 vehicles.** We install 5-8 vehicles per day
with our installation team. Zero operational disruption—most work
is done during off-hours.

Larger fleets (200+ vehicles): We deploy multiple teams.
100+ vehicles? Done in under 2 months.

---

### "What if drivers try to bypass the system?"

The buckle sensor is physically integrated. Can't be tricked with:
- ❌ Clicking belt without wearing it (seat sensor detects occupancy)
- ❌ Unplugging sensors (system logs and alerts manager)
- ❌ Wiring modifications (tamper-evident seals)

**94% compliance is average. The 6%? System logs for coaching.**

---

### "We already have GPS tracking. Do we need this?"

GPS tracks location. We track seat belt compliance.

Different data. Different value. GPS doesn't reduce your insurance.
Our system does.

**Most clients integrate both. Best of both worlds.**

---

### "What's the ROI for a 20-vehicle fleet?"

Based on average client data:
- System cost: ~$8,500 (20 vehicles)
- Insurance savings: ~$4,200/year
- Payback: 20 months
- 5-year net savings: ~$12,500

**Larger fleets see faster ROI.** Calculate your savings above.

---

### "Can we lease or finance?"

**Yes.** Financing from $199/month. Many clients find that monthly
insurance savings exceed the monthly payment.

From day one, you're cash-flow positive.
