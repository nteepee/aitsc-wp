# Common Installation Questions

### "Will installation damage my vehicle?"

**No.** Here's why:

- **Non-invasive mounting**: Sensors clip onto existing buckles
- **No drilling required**: Display mounts with adhesive or existing screws
- **Minimal wiring**: Uses existing pathways where possible
- **Reversible**: System can be removed without trace if needed

Your vehicle's resale value protected.

---

### "How long are vehicles off the road?"

**4-6 hours per vehicle.** Most clients schedule installations:
- **Fleets**: Overnight or weekends (back on road Monday morning)
- **School buses**: During holidays (zero disruption to routes)
- **Individual vehicles**: One day appointment

**Your operation continues. We work around your schedule.**

---

### "Do you install Australia-wide?"

**Yes.** Certified installers in:
- Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide
- Regional centers (Newcastle, Geelong, Gold Coast, etc.)
- Remote areas (we travel for fleet installations)

**Wherever you are, we can install.**

---

### "What if I have a really old vehicle?"

**No problem.** We've installed in:
- 1990s buses with original seat belts
- Classic coaches with custom upholstery
- Retrofitted vehicles with non-standard buckles
- Vehicles with weird wiring from previous modifications

**If it has seat belts, we can install.**

---

### "Can my own mechanic install?"

**Yes.** If you have a trusted mechanic:
- Share our installation guide
- We provide phone support to your mechanic
- Warranty still valid (hardware only, not labor)
- Your mechanic knows your vehicle best

**Many fleets use their own maintenance team. Works perfectly.**

---

### "What about warranty?"

**5-year warranty** includes:
- Display unit: Full coverage
- Sensors: Full coverage
- Wiring: Full coverage
- Labor: Full coverage (professional installs)

**Something fails? We replace it. Next-day shipping.**
**You're never unprotected.**

---

### "Do I need to buy a new system if I replace my vehicle?"

**No.** The system transfers:
- Unclip sensors (30 minutes)
- Remove display (5 minutes)
- Install in new vehicle (3-5 hours)

**Many clients transfer systems between lease vehicles.**
**One system. Multiple vehicles. Protected forever.**
