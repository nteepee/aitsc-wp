# Why Fleet managers Lose Sleep at Night

## One Unbuckled Kid = Lawsuit
School bus drivers can't monitor every seat, every stop. One accident
with an unbuckled student means bankruptcy-level liability, regulatory
fines, and a reputation that never recovers.

## Insurance Premiums Keep Rising
Insurers charge 30-50% more for fleets without documented safety systems.
You're paying thousands extra for what you DON'T have—proof that
passengers are actually belted.

## Drivers Are Human
They forget to check. They get distracted. They can't be everywhere
at once. Your multi-million dollar reputation rides on their vigilance
during a 12-hour shift.

## How It Works in 3 Seconds

1. **Sensors Detect**: Each seat belt buckle has a smart sensor that knows
   if it's clicked or not—within 50 milliseconds.

2. **Dashboard Shows**: The 7-inch display lights up seat-by-seat.
   White = buckled. Red = unbuckled. Black = empty.

3. **Alerts Trigger**: Driver sees exactly which seat needs attention.
   Audio reminder plays. Problem solved before you move.

# Common Questions (We Know You're Thinking Them)

### "Won't drivers hate this? We don't want more monitoring."

Actually, drivers LOVE it. Here's why: **It protects them from blame**.

When an accident happens and lawyers ask "Did you check every seat?",
drivers now have proof. The system logged it. They followed protocol.

> "I used to stress about checking 50 kids. Now I glance at the dashboard
> and know. It's made my job easier, not harder."
> — Sarah T., School Bus Driver, 12 years experience

---

### "How long does installation really take?"

**4-6 hours per vehicle.** Most fleets schedule installations overnight
and vehicles are back on the road by morning service.

Zero operational disruption.

---

### "What if we have mixed seating layouts?"

We custom-configure the display for **YOUR exact seating layout**.
No templates. No compromises.

Hiace buses with 4 rows? Done.
57-seat coaches? Done.
Mixed fleet? We configure each vehicle individually.

---

### "Is this going to break our budget?"

Most clients see **ROI within 3 months** through insurance premium
reductions alone.

- Average insurance savings: $3,000-$8,000/year per vehicle
- System pays for itself in 8-14 months
- We offer financing from $199/month

### "What happens if a sensor fails?"

Each sensor is independently wired. One failure doesn't affect the rest.
You'll know immediately which sensor to replace.

We ship replacements overnight. 5-year warranty covers everything.
