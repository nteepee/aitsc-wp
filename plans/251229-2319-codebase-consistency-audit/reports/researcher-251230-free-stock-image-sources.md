# Free Stock Image Sources - Australian Transport Context

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Topic:** Free stock images for Australian buses, coaches, taxis, fleet management scenarios

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Finding:** Authentic Australian-specific bus/transport images are **extremely limited** in free stock collections. Most results are US/European generics.

**Best Strategy:** Combine generic transport images from free sources with Australian government/Wikimedia Commons assets for authenticity.

---

## 1. Australian School Buses (Yellow/Cream, NSW/VIC)

### Reality Check
- **NSW school buses** are typically cream/orange (not US-style yellow)
- **Free stock availability**: Almost non-existent for authentic Australian variants

### Best Free Sources

| Source | Quantity | Quality | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| Unsplash | 2,600+ | High | Generic yellow buses (US-style) |
| Pixabay | 2,349+ | Medium | Generic only |
| FreeImages | Limited | Low-Med | Basic selection |

```

### Search Terms
- "school bus"
- "yellow school bus"
- "school bus australia" (yields minimal results)
- "orange school bus" (closer to NSW style)

### Workaround
Use generic yellow school buses + pair with Australian urban backgrounds from Unsplash ("Sydney street", "Melbourne road")

---

## 2. Australian Coaches (Charter Buses, Greyhound-Style)

### Free Sources

| Source | Quantity | Quality |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Unsplash | 500+ coach images | High |
| Vecteezy | 9,490+ public transport | Variable |

```

### Search Terms
- "coach bus"
- "charter bus"
- "tour bus"

## 3. Australian Taxi/Uber Vehicles

| Unsplash | 500+ taxi images | No |
| FreeImages | Moderate | No |

https://www.freeimages.com/search/taxi
```

### Australian Context (Paid but Noted)
- **iStock**: 340+ Sydney taxi photos (paid)
- **Getty Images**: 964 Sydney cab photos (paid)

### Workaround Strategy
1. Use generic taxi images from Unsplash
2. Combine with Australian street scenes:

   - "Melbourne street"
   - "Australian city"
