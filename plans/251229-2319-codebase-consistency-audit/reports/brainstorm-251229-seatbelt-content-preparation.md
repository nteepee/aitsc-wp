**Purpose**: Product specification for buckle sensor

### Hero Section
**Title**: Buckle Sensor Component
**Subtitle**: Intelligent Seat Belt Detection
**Hero Image**: `buckle molex pins.jpg`

### Component Overview

**Headline**: How It Works

**Content**:
```
The buckle sensor is the core detection component of the system. Installed within the seat belt buckle assembly, it detects whether the belt is latched or unlatched and sends a real-time signal to the control unit.

```

### Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Type | Magnetic reed switch / Hall effect |
| Connector | 2-pin Molex automotive connector |
| Wiring | 2-wire (red/black) |
| Voltage | 5-12V DC |
| Response Time | <50ms |
| Operating Temp | -40°C to +85°C |
| Durability | 100,000+ cycles |

### Installation

**Purpose**: Product specification for seat sensor

### Hero Section
**Title**: Seat Sensor Pad Component
**Subtitle**: Occupant Detection & Presence Sensing
**Hero Image**: `chair-seat-pad.png`

### Component Overview

**Headline**: Smart Occupant Detection

**Content**:
```
The seat sensor pad detects passenger presence and weight distribution. Installed under the seat cushion, it uses pressure-sensitive technology to determine if a seat is occupied, enabling intelligent alerts and preventing false warnings.

The layered construction combines a comfort cushion with embedded sensor elements, providing accurate detection without compromising passenger comfort.
```

### Specifications

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Type | Pressure-sensitive capacitive sensor |
| Layers | 2-layer foam construction |
| Thickness | 12mm (base) + 25mm (cushion) |
| Weight Detection | 5kg minimum trigger |
| Response Time | <100ms |
| Operating Temp | -30°C to +80°C |
| Dimensions | Customizable per seat |

### How It Works
1. **Pressure Detection**: Sensing elements detect weight distribution
2. **Signal Conversion**: Converts pressure to electrical signal
3. **Data Transmission**: Sends occupancy status to control unit
4. **False Alert Prevention**: Only triggers alerts when seat occupied

### Installation
- Installs under existing seat cushion
- No visible modification
- Connects via 2-wire harness
- Foam-sealed for moisture protection

### Applications
- Occupant detection for airbag suppression
- Passenger counting
- Weight distribution analysis
